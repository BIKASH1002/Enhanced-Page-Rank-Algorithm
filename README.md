# **Search Engine Performance Optimization Using Enhanced Page Ranking Algorithm**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the ever-expanding digital landscape, the efficiency and accuracy of search engines are pivotal to information retrieval. Traditional algorithms such as Google’s PageRank have laid the foundation for modern search techniques, yet they exhibit limitations in handling dynamic and large-scale web environments. This research designs an enhanced page ranking algorithm to improve search engine performance. Implemented in Google Colab, the proposed work incorporates Stother-William’s matrix multiplication in the page ranking algorithm, significantly reducing processing time of page rank in 0.04 to 15.7 seconds which is much faster than existing algorithms. The algorithm achieves superior convergence, stabilizing PageRank scores after approximately 25 iterations. PageRank scores reveal a highly skewed pattern with most nodes having low scores and a few nodes having significantly higher scores, highlighting key influential pages within the network. A strong positive correlation between proposed PageRank scores and in-degree centrality emphasizes the importance of incoming links in determining page relevance. On comparison with Google’s PageRank algorithm with the proposed algorithm, the proposed algorithm computes scores more efficiently, offering significant improvements in ranking accuracy and computational speed. This analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm is robust enough in identifying key web pages which further highlights its potential for large-scale applications such as web indexing and social network analysis.
